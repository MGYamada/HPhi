\chapter{Acknowledgement}
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Hidetoshi Nishimori and Mr. Daisuke Tahara.
Implementation of the Lanczos algorithm in $\HPhi$ written in C is based on the
pioneering diagonalization package TITPACK written in Fortran by Prof. Nishimori.
For developing the user interface of $\HPhi$, we follow the design concept of
the user interface in the program for variational Monte Carlo developed by Mr. Tahara.
A part of the user interface in $\HPhi$ is based on his original codes.
We would also like to thank the support from ``{\it Project for advancement of software usability in materials science}" by The Institute for Solid State Physics,
The University of Tokyo, for development of $\HPhi$ ver.0.1, ver.0.2, ver.0.3, ver.1.0, ver.1.1 and ver.1.2.
