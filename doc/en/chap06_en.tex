\chapter{Acknowledgement}
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Hidetoshi Nishimori and Mr. Daisuke Tahara.
Implementation of the Lanczos algorithm in $\HPhi$ written in C is based on the
pioneering diagonalization package TITPACK written in Fortran by Prof. Nishimori.
For developing the user interface of $\HPhi$, we followed the design concept of
the user interface in the program for variational Monte Carlo developed by Mr. Tahara.
A part of the user interface in $\HPhi$ is based on his original codes.
We would also like to express our thanks for the support of the ``{\it Project for advancement of software usability in materials science}" 
of The Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo, for the development of $\HPhi$ ver.0.1, ver.0.2, ver.0.3, ver.1.0, ver.1.1, ver.1.2, and ver.2.0.
