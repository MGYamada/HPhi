\subsection*{Introduction}

A numerical solver package for a wide range of quantum lattice models including Hubbard-\/type itinerant electron hamiltonians, quantum spin models, and Kondo-\/type hamiltonians for itinerant electrons coupled with quantum spins. The Lanczos algorithm for finding ground states and newly developed Lanczos-\/based algorithm for finite-\/temperature properties of these models are implemented for parallel computing. A broad spectrum of users including experimental researchers is cordially welcome.
